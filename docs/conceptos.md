## Conceptos más importantes

- **Decentralized identifier / DID**: a portable URL-based identifier associated with an entity.
- **Decentralized identifier document / DID document**: a document that is accessible using a verifiable data registry and contains information related to a specific decentralized identifier, _such as the associated repository and public key information_.
- **Claim**: an assertion made about a subject.
- **Credencial Verificable / Verifiable Credential / VC**: a set of one or more claims made by an issuer.
- **Holder**: a role an entity might perform by possessing one or more verifiable credentials and generating presentations from them. A holder is usually, but not always, a subject of the verifiable credentials they are holding.Holders store their credentials in credential repositories.
- **Issuer**: a role an entity can perform by asserting claims about one or more subjects, creating a verifiable credential from these claims, and transmitting the verifiable credential to a holder.
- **Presentation**: data derived from one or more verifiable credentials, issued by one or more issuers, that is shared with a specific verifier.
- **Verifiable presentation**: it's a tamper-evident presentation encoded in such a way that authorship of the data can be trusted after a process of cryptographic verification.
- **digital signature / firma digital**: a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message.
- **Identity provider / IdP**: It's a system for creating, maintaining, and managing identity information for holders.
- **Repository**: a program, such as a storage vault or personal verifiable credential wallet, that stores and protects access to holders' verifiable credentials.
- **Selective disclosure**: the ability of a holder to make fine-grained decisions about what information to share.
- **User agent**: A program, such as a browser or other Web client, that mediates the communication between holders, issuers, and verifiers.
- **Validation**: the assurance that a verifiable credential or a verifiable presentation meets the needs of a verifier and other dependent stakeholders
- **Verifiable data registry**: a role a system might perform by mediating the creation and verification of identifiers, keys, and other relevant data, such as verifiable credential schemas, revocation registries, issuer public keys, and so on, which might be required to use verifiable credentials.
- **Verification**: the evaluation of whether a verifiable credential or verifiable presentation is an authentic and timely statement of the issuer or presenter, respectively.
- **Verifier**: a role an entity performs by receiving one or more verifiable credentials, optionally inside a verifiable presentation for processing. Other specifications might refer to this concept as a relying party.

## Notas importantes

- A *verifiable presentation* expresses data from one or more *verifiable credentials*, and is packaged in such a way that the authorship of the data is verifiable.
- A *holder* is usually, but not always, a subject of the *verifiable credentials* they are holding. *Holders* store their credentials in *credential repositories*.
- A *verifiable credential* itself can be easily ported from one *repository* to another without the need to reissue the credential.
- It is assumed the *verifiable credentials* remain with the *subject*, and if they are not, they were stolen by an attacker.
- Certain types of *verifiable presentations* might contain data that is synthesized from, but do not contain, the original verifiable credentials.
- If a single *verifiable credential* supports *selective disclosure*, then *holders* can present proofs of claims without revealing the entire *verifiable credential*.
- *Issuers* can issue *verifiable credentials* that support *selective disclosure*.
- The process of *verification* includes checking that: the credential (or presentation) conforms to the specification; the proof method is satisfied; and, if present, the status check succeeds.
- This specification is constrained to verifying *verifiable credentials* and *verifiable presentations* regardless of their usage. Validating *verifiable credential*s or *verifiable presentations* is outside the scope of this specification.

**Repo**
- https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry

**Brief**
> This library contains the Ethereum contract code that allows the owner of an ethr-did identity to update the attributes that appear in its did-document. It exposes an API that allows developers to call the contract functions using Javascript.
> 
> Use this if you want to interact directly with a deployed registry contract directly, or deploy a copy of the contract to another Ethereum network.
> 
> It's designed for resolving public keys for off-chain authentication—where the public key resolution is handled by using decentralized technology.
> 
> This contract allows Ethereum addresses to present signing information about themselves with no prior registration. It allows them to perform key rotation and specify different keys and services that are used on its behalf for both on and off-chain usage.

**Features**
- Looking up Identity Ownership
- Changing Identity Ownership
- Looking up a Delegate (check Delegate Validity)
- Adding a Delegate

### uPort Transports

**Brief**
> The uport-transports library is comprised of a loosely coupled collection of functions called transports—used to set up communication channels between an app and a client; additionally, a set of transport-related utility functions are also available in this library.

**Features**
- Send messages to users using a QR code
- Send requests and receive responses through URLs
- Send encrypted push notifications
- Create Transports specific to your use case and environment

> 
>It handles the communication channel between your app and a uPort client, which can vary depending on the environment which your application runs.
> 
> Over this communication channel you can send requests for a user's data, share credentials, generate transactions to be signed by a user and relay requests you originally created on your server with uport-credentials
> 
> This library offers the default quick start implementation to integrate with uPort, but if it doesn't offer exactly what you need, you may be interested in using uport-tranports and uport-credentials instead.

**Features**
- Handle user logins
- Request Ethereum transaction signing
- Keep your users logged into an app
- Use QR code & push notification flow for desktop browsers

### Ethereum transaction request

- https://developer.uport.me/credentials/transactions

> It is possible with uport-credentials to create an ethereum transaction request and have a mobile client approve and sign that transaction.
